# Chassis-Design-and-Analysis-Using-SolidWorks-and-Ansys-for-Different-Materials
The project focuses on optimizing automobile chassis design using advanced materials to reduce
weight while maintaining crash safety. ANSYS software is employed for structural simulation
and material optimization, balancing performance, strength, and safety. The Indian automotive
industry is transitioning to lighter materials, such as aluminum alloys and composites, to
enhance efficiency. Challenges in cost, scalability, and integration of new materials remain in
the adoption of lighter materials in chassis design. ANSYS-driven optimization provides a
promising solution to meet both safety and environmental goals in the automotive sector.
